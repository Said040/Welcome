- Hi, the name is Said. Nice to Meet You!
  
- Worked on CS50 in summer 2025. Trying to retain as many programming skills as I can
- Graduated from Triton College with an Associate of Science in Spring 2025.
- Transferred to UIC Fall 2025, working to get a Bachelor's Degree
  
- New to Github but I'm going to post some code that I've implemented.
- Not hard programs but programs to keep my mind running.
- Most programs will be written in C++, which I'm most proficient in.

- I hope that whatever I choose will take my family through an easy life
